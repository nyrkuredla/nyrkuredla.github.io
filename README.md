# Source for my GitHub Page

This repository contains the **source content** for my site on GitHub Pages.

Publishing is handled automatically:
- Source lives here (Markdown, config, etc.) on *gh-pages*.
- Publishing is handled via MkDocs and CI, which builds the site and pushes the result to GitHub Pages.
