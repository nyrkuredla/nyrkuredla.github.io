Here's some of what they had to say:</p> <p>\"Ryan consistently delivers high quality products, on time and above expectations. She has a reputation for being prepared for anything, willing to jump in at moment's notice, and being able to adapt to changing situations with grace and a sense of calm that is reassuring to others. It is abundantly clear that Ryan is extremely knowledgable about change management processes, working with technical clients and teams, and implementing process improvement plans/strategies... Her attention to detail, ability to rapidly leverage her experience for new products, and technical expertise has helped our team build out a substantial repository of internal SOPs and best practices. In large part due to Ryan's efforts, these documents are easy to understand, comprehensive, accessible to technical and non-technical stakeholders, and regularly updated.</p> <p>...Overall, Ryan continuously makes recommendations for how to make things better, strongly executes existing processes, facilitates team discussions, fosters inclusion, and rolls up her sleeves to do outstanding work for our clients, our team, and Booz Allen. I am honored to be working with Ryan and our entire team is very grateful to be working with such a talented individual.\" - Organizational Transformation and Change Consultant, Booz Allen</p> <p>\"Ryan is an invaluable asset to our team, and to Booz Allen overall. She repeatedly goes above and beyond in her role, is always available for questions or assistance, and routinely jumps in to learn new things or assist without being asked. I genuinely appreciate all that she has brought to our project and look forward to working with her every day. Thank you, Ryan, for all that you do!\" - Information Assurance Engineer, Booz Allen</p> <p>\"I cannot say enough about the tremendous value that Ryan brings every day to the Team and to the overall Project. In her position as Release/Change Manager, she plays an invaluable role of driving key client-facing activities. Day after day, Ryan gives all of her work an attention to detail that sets a high standard for her peers, regardless of the number of moving pieces involved. She serves as a steady, centralizing force for the Team to ensure that Client needs and deliveries are met, on-time and to specification. She is not afraid of new challenges, instead decisively and methodically breaking down the issue and properly structuring time and resources to overcome. Her individual contribution and work quality always exceed expectations and translate into an exemplary Firm image to our clients.\" - Release Train Engineer (RTE), Booz Allen</p> <p>\"I have had the pleasure of working with Ryan in a number of different capacities over the last several months, and she never ceases to amaze me with her ability to jump in and contribute to a project from the moment she joins. Ryan has a knack for creating order out of disorder, an innate ability to address areas of ambiguity with structured yet lightweight processes that enable her team to formulate creative solutions from a stable foundation. This knack of hers was most evident to me during Ryan's brief time on a migration effort. We were in the final two months of the project when she joined as our Technical Writer, yet her presence was immediately felt across the board. Whereas our previous Technical Writer had only assisted with the maintenance of two contractual deliverables, Ryan became the team's point person for all migration-related documentation. Internal SOPs, configuration baselines, architecture diagrams, cross-team lunch and learn presentations, targeted client presentations - she produced all of them, all with minimal guidance and all via a combination of independent analysis and interviews with various team members. She was the key driver in our team's knowledge transfer activities with development, PaaS/SaaS, and Production Operations teams, and proved essential in fostering collaboration between all parties involved. All this she did with a smile on her face and a witty remark at the ready. The team was exponentially better for Ryan having joined it, and for that I can give no higher praise.\" RTE, Booz Allen</p> <p>\"This award is to recognize Ryan's passionate service to our team. Ryan consistently goes above and beyond her role as a release manager and is consistently commended by her peers in regards! She consistently is a driving force for continuous improvement, and without her, our area would not shine as brightly.\" DevOps Engineer, Booz Allen</p> <p>\"Ryan has transformed the Change and Release Manager role... She stepped in to this vital role at a time when the project required stability and authority from the position. She got up to speed on the existing processes quickly and immediately began identifying opportunities to improve the value that the position provided to the ProdOps team and our clients. Over the last 9 months she has streamlined the process for request and approval, led the effort to migrate work items from RTC to Jira, bridged the gap between development and operations teams during the migration to GitHub for property management, and assisted with the ramp-up of change and release management for the wider project.\" System Train Engineer (STE), Booz Allen</p> <p>\"Ryan was an excellent team member for our team. Ryan held not only the highest professionalism and courteous attitude, but also maintained the highest standards of competence and delivery. Her role was not defined by the title of Technical Writer, but the immense value she added to the team. She was critical to the team's acceleration of delivery, automation of fundamental tasks, and a thought leader on improvements. I am glad to see her move on to greater opportunity, but in earnest we did not lose just a tech writer but a solid team member.\" Director of Engineering, Booz Allen</p>","tags":["about-me","work-life","feedback"]},{"location":"about/working-with-me/#strengthsfinder-top-6","title":"StrengthsFinder top 6","text":"<p>For those who like that kind of thing, myself included.

There's a lot, a lot, to recommend typing and even voice capture, and they indisputably have their benefits - speed, neatness, ease of editing, compatibility with other invaluable applications... it's hard to even imagine a time before Track Changes and SharePoint and the like made it seamless to share what you're working on with others. (The auto-save feature alone... as a millenial, I unfortunately have access to the collective consciousness of the horror where the power goes out and you realize you haven't hit Save on your biology term paper since 3:00 and it's almost midnight and due tomorrow...!). </p> <p>I've also recently typed a lot into LLM windows for ideating, brainstorming, and so on. I've experimented with AI for, among other things, project and trip planning, recipe tweaking, and even some creative writing (with admittedly mixed results). It has its uses, for sure, and I've been enjoying playing with it to discover my own groove. I certainly don't think it's going anywhere, at any rate.</p> <p>All of that said, I've also been doing more handwriting lately, and actually turning away from typing and GPT for certain things. I'm still feeling it out, but my \"handwriting preferred\" modes tend to fall into two general flavors:</p> <ul> <li> <p>When I need to memorize or \"bake in\" content. I've prepared for a lot of tests and exams in my time, and have tried a lot of different tools for studying and reviewing material. In short, although LLMs are incredible tutors, they can't actually learn the material for me. It's unfortunately very easy to move a lot of words around on a screen without actually internalizing the content. To actually memorize or get concepts baked into my brain, to this day, nothing has worked better for me than writing study notes out by hand, and writing flash cards by hand to review. I'm also a big believer in the aesthetics of study, and there's something about having just the right pen (extra-fine point rollerball, please), a cute notebook, and bright, cheerful highlighters to help solidify a concept. Once I've got a grasp on the material, then it's time to open up ChatGPT and ask it to quiz me. </p> </li> <li> <p>Related, when I need to process something. Journaling, venting, even to-do lists - I've experimented with typing these, and have justified it on the grounds of \"if I just write it in a random notebook, how will I be able to find it later?\" But this assumes that I even want to find anything later, which in my case I've come to realize is a flawed assumption. I've got piles of old journals in a box in my office which I haven't opened once, and honestly recoil at the thought of re-reading. More to the point, journaling, to me, isn't an exercise I do for posterity; it's a cobweb-clearing activity, a way to get messy, raw things out of my brain so I can go about the rest of my day (shout out to Julia Cameron!). In that respect, posterity is pressure, and the ease of editing typed documents actually works against me. I find myself self-editing, questioning, doubting, and not writing. </p> <ul> <li>This also goes for early stages of creative writing as well - LLMs, for example, are fun for ideation and riffing, but (for me, anyway) fall short of getting actual (me-sounding) words on the page. I've experimented with describing a scene in detail and having ChatGPT produce a first draft, for example, thinking that it would help me get over \"the terror of the blank page\", but so far it's caused more headaches than it's mitigated - I end up frustrated that it sounds so wrong and get bogged down in trying to fix something that I didn't even write in the first place. So: messy first drafts when I'm just trying to get something, anything, on paper are still hand-written, and transcribed into type later when it's time to make more sense/edit.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The common factors between these modes seem to be that the writing is in some way ethereal or disposable (it's only for me; I don't intend to return to it once complete; I don't need to search it later). Content that I plan to share with others, that I plan to return to or refer to later, or that I want to save for posterity for some other reason, gets typed. </p> <p>As more and more people experiment with AI tools for content creation, and learn their own personal approaches and best practices for learning and knowledge management, I suspect there will be a revival or rediscovery of the benefits of writing by hand. One can hope, anyway - it's one of those small pleasures, after all, and we could all surely use more of those. I haven't found a good substitute for the scritch of pen, the smell of good paper, etc., nor for the singular satisfaction of looking up and seeing an entire page filled top to bottom with your own handwriting. (Even if no one else can read it, as my friends remind me about my penmanship. Maybe especially if.) </p>","tags":["ai","writing","handwriting","creativity","llm"]},{"location":"blog/2025/07/12/just-call-me-sony-walkman-cause-im-a-cd-player/","title":"Just call me Sony Walkman, 'cause I'm a CD player","text":"<p>insert excited squeals</p> <p>BLUF: I got my very own CD pipeline going with GitLab! Hot dog! Not bad for a sweatpants Saturday. </p> <p>Background: CI/CD stands for \"Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery\", and it's a widely-used practice in software development which enables teams to automate different stages of the release lifecycle (for example, building, testing, validation, and deployment to different environments). Automation is fantastic because it ensures that a baseline of steps are applied the same way each time, thus eliminating both the time it would take to do everything manually, as well as the potential for slip-ups or deviation from standard. In other words, it helps teams deploy their code quickly, cleanly, and reliably.</p> <p>Details: For my site specifically, my \"before\" update workflow looked like this:</p> <ol> <li>Make updates (e.g., write a blog post) in Cursor.</li> <li>Save the changes.</li> <li>Commit and push the changes to GitLab, where my source code is tracked.</li> <li>Build the MkDocs site manually.</li> <li>Copy the /site folder to another directory which pushes to my GitHub Pages repo.</li> <li>Commit and push the /site file changes to GitHub, which actually displays the changes.</li> </ol> <p>Friends, no one has time for all this, and the chances were extremely high that I would simply forget to actually push the changes to GitHub at all. (One of the things I really like about MkDocs is that you can preview your changes as you're making them, but this also lends me to believe that those changes are actually live when they're not!) Now, my workflow looks like this:</p> <ol> <li>Make updates (e.g., write a blog post) in Cursor.</li> <li>Save the changes.</li> <li>Commit and push the changes to GitLab, where my source code is tracked. </li> </ol> <p>That's it! GitLab automatically pushes the changes to GitHub Pages for me. </p> <p>Now, a caveat at this point is that whenever I commit changes to source (i.e., GitLab), they will go live immediately on GitHub. I don't necessarily want that in the long term (I'll likely look at implementing releases soon, to be able to better batch updates), but for right now, it's nice to have the deployment streamlined a bit.

I think that this inability to \"put it somewhere in the top ten of the number one priority list\" can arise for several reasons: one of the biggest culprits I've personally observed is when a team expands really quickly, KM doesn't scale accordingly, and a total monster is created. </p> <p>It might look like this:</p> <ol> <li>Small, tight-knit, fast-moving team works in close coordination on a project that is ambitious, but early enough in its conception that it's feasible for just a few SMEs to be working on it. Because the project is small and the team is tightly coupled, there's a lot of tacit, institutional knowledge shared informally among the group (hello, Slack threads). It's common for someone to be the \"go-to\" person for particular tasks or questions, and the small group of SMEs tend to handle issues or inquiries personally on the fly. </li> <li>The team and the project both expand, fast, and the original SMEs are either promoted into lead positions or otherwise abstracted away from the hands-on work they were originally doing. Lots of new hires hit the team and begin to get tasks delegated to them that the original SMEs were doing (or, worse, the original SMEs keep firefighting because they're too busy to properly hand off tasks). The people with the most context are now too busy to document what they know.</li> <li>The first wave of new hires either shadow SMEs to learn how to perform tasks, and may document their findings, or just do their best to improvise new processes for new tasks as they come up. The first wave of new hires become the new SMEs for the product, another wave of new hires join the team, and the process repeats. Everyone is so busy trying to either onboard, learn the product, train others, or stand up new product lines or teams, that it leaves little time for knowledge capture. There is little to no set standard/template or standard process for writing, publishing, or updating documentation, which leads to a chilling effect for even people who have the time and inclination to document things.</li> <li>A year later, the knowledge base/SharePoint site/Confluence site/what have you is an unholy stew of outdated articles, orphaned attachments, broken links, and siloed actually-still-useful artifacts that only a few people know how to find. No one bothers with the sidebar or homepage, but rather Slacks each other the one or two links that have relevant information on them, often with disclaimers like \"Step 5 says to (x), but ignore that. You actually have to...\"</li> <li>The knowledge/documentation debt becomes unsustainable, and it's determined that something needs to be done to, uh, document stuff - but the original issues of \"everyone is so busy\" not only haven't gone away, they may have gotten worse. In addition, lots of the articles/documentation that's marginally useful was written by people who have since left the team, processes have fractured, Humpty Dumpty is in the arms of an angel, and who can afford all the kings horse's and all the king's men?</li> </ol> <p>At this point, even strong teams can struggle to dig themselves out.</p> <p>If this sounds familiar, don't despair - you're definitely not alone. I'd even go so far as to say that this is a normal experience for expanding teams, and requires rather remarkable foresight and effort from the outset to forestall. To be honest, I've rarely seen it done well. But my recommendation would be, for those wanting to try: dedicate, empower, and integrate a KM specialist from the very beginning, or as close as possible, to drive knowledge capture and knowledge management culture. </p> <p>Like security or FinOps, knowledge management is above all a distributed issue, but it only works with a clear owner; everyone has a role to play, but it's imperative to have a centralized person or team in place to help set and socialize quality standards, assist team members with questions, and generally be \"the voice\" of knowledge management on a team. </p> <p>In short: if no one does it, no one will do it - and if no priority is set, the priority level is automatically \"zero\". </p>","tags":["work","work-life","km"]},{"location":"blog/2025/08/08/things-i-read-this-week-1-km-failures-ai-roboros-and-the-worst-neologism-ever/","title":"Things I Read This Week #1: KM Failures, AI-roboros, and the Worst Neologism Ever","text":"<p>I returned to work after a personal leave of absence last week; between that and some other personal stuff going on, I didn't have the spoons to write a post.

The article pinpoints knowledge management as a central, non-negotiable prerequisite that many organizations kinda gloss over before throwing AI at a problem. The result is, at best, delayed timelines for implementation while data is audited, organized, formatted for AI, contextualized, and properly curated and maintained; at worst (I reckon far more commonly), completely untrustworthy and irreplicable results from a black box model trained on data that no one fully understands or can articulate. </p> <p>And even worse than that, it's not a given that the untrustworthy model would even be recognized as such.

In short, it's very VERY easy and undoubtedly tempting to say \"high accuracy number good\", but the reality is that all you know is that \"high accuracy number high\", not that \"high\" = \"good\" for the task, nor that \"accuracy number\" is the right number to be looking at in the first place.) </p> <p>One wonders how many of the projects currently having AI thrown at them would be sufficiently, if not better, addressed by just implementing the robust KM practices you'd need to have in place anyway to make the AI implementation a success.

Hutchins was talking here about generative AI specifically, but I'd include other applications as well; referring back to a previous point, it's likely that some if not many use cases currently being addressed by \"sprinkling some AI on it\"<sup>2</sup> could be addressed just as well if not better by more conventional means - better KM, judiciously applied statistics, etc. </p> <p>Hutchins goes on to say a lot of really insightful stuff about the \"big tech AI hedge bet\" on the race to AGI, \"trickle-down hypenomics\", and more about how LLMs specifically will not be the answer to AGI despite receiving a huge amount of the attention (seriously, just go read the article - he lays all of this out much better than I can paraphrase).

As such, it\u2019s likely people significantly overestimate how much their work (prompting) contributed to the output they received, and grossly underestimate how much of other peoples\u2019 work was required to make it possible. It\u2019s classic egocentric bias.</p> <p>This kind of bias leads to people ignoring the threat LLMs pose to their own data sources. The problem is further amplified by AI slop (low-quality AI generated content), which floods the internet, degrading the average quality of information. This slop not only makes it harder for humans to find high-quality sources, but harder to train LLMs, since allowing the slop to enter LLMs datasets risks creating a feedback loop which could cause the LLM to undergo model collapse.</p> <p>I don't know about you, reader, but I've already noticed the proliferation of obviously AI-generated content across the web. Hell, I've played with generating some myself (not this site/blog - this is all me, baby!). It's admittedly fun and a cool parlor trick, and it can even be useful to word-vomit into a ChatGPT window and have it re-organize your thoughts into something more coherent. </p> <p>However, for all the glitter and fun, there are some seriously dark implications for the Internet, for data, for individuals, and for society. (I'm not even going to touch the environmental impact here, as that's well beyond my area of expertise, but there's obviously plenty to keep you up at night about there too.) Hutchins speaks above to some of these: the mass-scale copyright infringement and theft required to train these LLMs in the first place; the ongoing threat to the quality of data and chilling effect on new, original, content; the inevitable ebb of LLM training, or at least of training quality, as a result of the degradation across the Internet. </p> <p>Hutchins doesn't speak to this directly, but I've been thinking a lot about AI-generated image quality in particular, and how that's evolved over the last couple years. Just a few years ago (maybe not even? what even is time anymore), it was easy to tell at a glance that an image had been AI-generated; there were certain tells (number of fingers or limbs, a weirdly grainy, over-saturated quality to a lot of images, etc.) and a certain uncanny-valley-ness that was easy to pinpoint if not describe. That \"uncanny valley\" only lasted a few years, though. Nowadays, it's getting harder and harder to tell what's been AI-generated or altered, or not. This Reddit post from two years ago shows the evolution in Midjourney from v1 to v5 and already at that point one could be forgiven for failing to notice at a glance that the v5 image was AI-generated. And that was two years ago! Two years ago is a whole era ago in terms of AI evolution.</p> <p>In terms of text, we're still in the \"uncanny valley\" era where you can \"just tell\" that something has been generated by ChatGPT: the dashes, the \"it's not [x], it's [y]\" phrasing, emoji-fronted checklists, obnoxious calls to action at the end of every paragraph. But we'll surely move past that soon if not already (I haven't tried out GPT5 yet; maybe today's the day!) and I think that will be the true existential threat to the Internet or certain chunks of the Internet (hello Reddit). The unwritten social contract and trust underlying message boards and social media since their inception will be irrevocably broken: if I have no reason to believe that there are any humans left on the Internet (or any way to tell who is human from what is an AI agent), why would I go there to socialize?</p>","tags":["KM","AI"]},{"location":"blog/2025/08/08/things-i-read-this-week-1-km-failures-ai-roboros-and-the-worst-neologism-ever/#faux-ductivity-llms-as-brain-candy","title":"Faux-ductivity: LLMs as Brain Candy<sup>4</sup>","text":"<p>Hutchins also wrote at length in his article about the threats implicit in LLM use not only on an internet-wide level, but also to the individual using it.</p> <p>Per Hutchins:</p> <p>By allowing people to quickly summarize &amp; manipulate the work of others, LLMs use gives the same feeling of achievement one would get from doing the work themselves, but without any of the heavy lifting...</p> <p>LLMs are somewhat like lossy compression of the entire internet. They boil nuanced topics down into a form that isn\u2019t quite layperson level, but loses a lot of nuance while still evoking a feeling of complete understanding. The part that\u2019s missing is, you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. If you lack an intricate understanding of the task you\u2019re using an LLM for, you have no idea what nuance was lost, or worse, what facts it made up...</p> <p>When people use LLMs, they aren\u2019t just being presented with flimsy surface level understandings of topics. They\u2019re often outsourcing many of their means of reinforcing knowledge to the AI too. And in some cases, their logic and reasoning itself. The more people lean on LLMs, the more likely they are limit their knowledge expansion, undergo skill regression, and weaken their logic and reasoning ability.</p> <p>Basically: LLM usage can not only make you feel like you've understood something when you haven't (even assuming that the summary it gives is factual, which we've already established is not actually a safe assumption!); LLMs can also make you feel like you've accomplished or produced something when you haven't. </p> <p>I've experienced this personally. As I've written about before, LLMs make it very easy, and actually actively encourage you to, produce tons of words about a topic, without actually leaving the chat window to go work on it, or solidify what you've 'discussed'. It's basically that feeling of looking up from a book and realizing you didn't take in the last 3 paragraphs you read, except magnified. </p> <p>In terms of actually producing or doing things, it's so so enticing and convincing to feel like you've accomplished a lot, but when you walk away, it's all just ephemeral words in a box. A GPT will encourage and cheerlead you all the livelong day to build out a 90-day learning plan to study for whatever exam, build a tracker for your new fitness or nutrition plan, whatever, and it'll feel good! But then when you get up from your desk, you'll still have just spent hours sitting at your desk staring at a screen by yourself and you won't actually have produced anything even though it feels like you did. </p> <p>Of course, the LLM doesn't care what you've produced; after all, your engagement with the LLM is the primary measure of success for proprietary LLMs, not whether you actually go do/learn the thing or not. But for you, the person who actually sat down presumably wanting to plan to do something, this is a problem.<sup>5</sup></p>","tags":["KM","AI"]},{"location":"blog/2025/08/08/things-i-read-this-week-1-km-failures-ai-roboros-and-the-worst-neologism-ever/#the-hypothetical-ai-accelerated-employee","title":"\"The Hypothetical AI-Accelerated Employee\"","text":"<p>Hutchins wraps up his article by addressing \"the hypothetical AI-accelerated employee\":</p> <p>The popular wisdom that\u2019s seen as somewhat of a middle ground between \u201cLLMs are useless plagiarism machines\u201d and \u201cLLMs are going to replace everything ever\u201d is the hypothetical AI-accelerated employee.

(I've dabbled with it, but quickly ran into the problem of the generated code outpacing what I understood about how it worked, and I abandoned my attempts after a few days of feeding error codes back into Cursor and getting increasingly unintelligible results.)  </p> <p>Anyway. An inherent problem with LLMs, and one that is a basic component of their design (so impossible to fully mitigate), is that of hallucination: LLMs are essentially designed to mimic language (or in this case, machine language/code) convincingly based on the language or code they've been trained on. They have no ability to \"understand\" or reason about what they produce. They are therefore prone to \"hallucinating\" or making reference to events that never happened, court cases that never existed, etc. In the case of code, this includes software packages that don't exist, but that sound like others which do actually exist. </p> <p>For example, per the Wikipedia article:</p> <p>In 2023, security researcher Bar Lanyado noted that LLMs hallucinated a package named \"huggingface-cli\".While this name is identical to the command used for the command-line version of HuggingFace Hub, it is not the name of the package. The software is correctly installed with the code pip install -U \"huggingface_hub[cli]\". Lanyado tested the potential for slopsquatting by uploading an empty package under this hallucinated name. In three months, it had received over 30,000 downloads.</p> <p>In other words, the package is called two separate things in two separate contexts: the package is correctly called huggingface_hub[cli] when you want to install it with pip, but when have actually installed the package and want to use it, you call it by huggingface-cli. The LLMs saw the huggingface-cli invocation command and incorrectly assumed that the installation command would use the same name for the package. </p> <p>Under normal circumstances, if you try to use pip install with an incorrect package name, you typically just get an error; up until now, it would be pretty clear when you're intending to install something specific and just typo the name or whatever, since presumably you'd be looking at documentation of some kind or other for the package. In other words, it's much more likely that you'd fail outright, and much less likely that you'd accidentally install something other than what you intended to install. Additionally, you'd presumably be looking at the command line yourself and have some expectation for what the output should look like even if you somehow managed to install the wrong thing, and have the knowhow to uninstall it. </p> <p>But now, with LLMs abstracting away both the documentation (from the source side) and the explicit understanding/instruction (from the user side), there's room for a researcher to, say, create a dummy package that will get installed instead of the correct one next time the LLM hallucinates the same wrong command based on the same faulty assumption from the training data (which unfortunately happens a lot!). It also means that vibe-coding users are less likely to even realize that the package they actually wanted wasn't actually installed, and/or that their application isn't behaving as expected, especially if the malicious package creator did any amount of work to hide their tracks (which would presumably be trivial for a dedicated cybercriminal who also have access to generative AI coding tools!). </p> <p>Again, I have no clue how one would go about defending against or even detecting this problem. Just add it to the 4:00AM brain tape reel, I guess. </p> <p>This is a kind of extension of a conversation I had recently with a friend who's a cyber threat researcher. This friend mentioned that their workplace is heavily encouraging use of AI to generate reports and, well, research threats, but the problem (besides the obvious of essentially requiring experts to train their AI replacements) is that AI is entirely credulous: it has no way to discern when someone is (gasp) lying on the Internet. The AI equivalent of \"yup, this package looks totally legit, it has a GitHub README and everything\", or \"this construction site project can't be a scam, it has a website with stock photos of people in hard hats holding clipboards\" - again, pointing back to the human domain expertise factor of it all.  </p> <p>I don't really have a wrap-up for all this, sorry. It's Friday as I finish this draft I've been working on for days, the sunshine is calling me outside, and it seems fitting that I'd leave off without a ChatGPT-esque call to action.

There have been APIs of one type or another for as long as there have been networked computers, but these days, most people say \"API\" to refer to a specific type of API called a Representational State Transfer (REST) API. </p> <p>...which is both true, and a statement that is so generic that it doesn't really impart much. It's like saying that Seinfeld was \"an influential sitcom\"; REST APIs (hereafter I'll just refer to them as \"APIs\") are so much a part of the landscape now that it's hard to grasp how much of a game-changer they really were.

The secret sauce is in networking - that is, connecting different computers together to handle different pieces of a complex workload. </p> <p>In the wild west of early computing, computers received input using physical media like punch cards, which could only be encoded once and were prone to damage (or, dog forbid, someone dropping a deck that would then need to be resorted into the correct order). Even once computers could talk directly to each other, there was still no standard way to store or share data between systems, so custom programming was often needed to bridge the gap between incompatible formats. This process was, as one might imagine, tedious, error-prone, and difficult if not impossible to scale. </p> <p>To put this in perspective, imagine going to a fast-food restaurant. The process for ordering food is simple: </p> <ol> <li>Look at a menu of available options </li> <li>Walk to a counter and order from the menu (or punch in your order at a touch-screen) </li> <li>Pay</li> <li>Tasty food appears</li> </ol> <p>No matter where you go, the experience is consistent, as well as being mostly hands-off for you, aside from choosing what you want to eat. </p> <p>The food is also the same. If I order a Big Mac and fries in Boston, it will be the same Big Mac experience as if I order in San Diego or Helsinki.</p> <p>Now imagine the same restaurant...but there's no menu, no counter, and no guidance. There are ingredients around, but no recipes to tell you what to do with them. You might piece together something edible, but maybe you didn't know the right proportions for the secret sauce, or the right temperature for the grill. </p> <p>And even if you do figure out a semi-good, not-sad meal, what happens if you go to the same place next time and the walk-in has been rearranged, or ingredients swapped out? You'd have to figure out all over again where everything is, and you still don't know how to make the secret sauce.</p> <p>From the restaurant's perspective, this is also a nightmare: customers wandering around in the kitchen willy-nilly, leaving dirty dishes and spills, wasting or contaminating ingredients... it's no way to run a business.</p> <p>This pre-API chaos is what early inter-computer communication felt like. Everyone had ingredients, but no shared recipe - just lots of sad food and burned fingers. </p>      Your browser does not support the video tag.    The Cornballer comes for us all, at the REST-less restaurant. <p>That\u2019s why (REST) APIs were revolutionary: they gave everyone the same menu, counter, and prep instructions. Suddenly, systems could work together quickly, efficiently, scalably, and without trashing the kitchen.</p> <p>Next time, on API Masterpiece Theater: what does a REST API actually look like?
