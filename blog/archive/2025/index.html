<p>I returned to work after a personal leave of absence last week; between that and some other personal stuff going on, I didn't have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory">spoons</a> to write a post. I also basically tried too hard to have a Good Idea to write about, which put me off blogging entirely for a bit, so I just decided to not.</p>
<figure>
<p><img alt="last-minute-panic" src="../../../assets/images/last-minute-panic.jpg" /></p>
<figcaption>
<p>This doesn't work though if there's no one inducing panic and it's only me writing for me. Alas.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In retrospect, I think that part of the Good Idea failing to materialize is that I was trying to force myself to have clever, useful, marketable things to say specifically in reference to AI, ideally more specifically around generative AI. After all, it's topical, newsworthy, <em>engaging</em>, <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/gpt-5-it-just-does-stuff">there's lots going on</a>! </p>
<p>In practice, though, I've found myself disengaging a bit from AI, taking a step (further) back from the cutting edge. I seem to have passed through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_shock#Oberg's_four_phases_model">honeymoon stage</a> of Oberg's culture shock model, and am now on to the "negotiation" stage (the equivalent of an expat being irritatedly baffled by things like confusing lines at the post office or being unable to work out a ticket machine, or, say, getting tricked into pouring <a href="https://www.mlekarna-kunin.cz/vyrobky/acidofilni-mleko/">a completely unpleasant surprise</a> on your cornflakes<sup id="fnref2:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../../2025/08/08/things-i-read-this-week-1-km-failures-ai-roboros-and-the-worst-neologism-ever/#fn:1">1</a></sup>).  </p>
<p>My personal negotiation stage is still unfolding, and I'm sure I'll have more coherent thoughts about it in the not-too-distant future; in the meantime, I want to highlight a few things I read this week that helped flesh this feeling out for me a little:</p>
<h3 id="why-your-ai-is-only-as-smart-as-your-knowledge-management-the-hidden-foundation-of-effective-ai-implementation-cannonco"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/08/08/things-i-read-this-week-1-km-failures-ai-roboros-and-the-worst-neologism-ever/#why-your-ai-is-only-as-smart-as-your-knowledge-management-the-hidden-foundation-of-effective-ai-implementation-cannonco"><a href="https://cannonco.net/why-your-ai-is-only-as-smart-as-your-knowledge-management-the-hidden-foundation-of-effective-ai-implementation/">Why Your AI is Only as Smart as Your Knowledge Management: The Hidden Foundation of Effective AI Implementation</a> (CannonCo)</a></h3>
<p>As the title suggests, this article claims that, while breathless headlines and frothy demos promise the world, <strong>many <em>actual</em> AI implementations not only fail to meet expectations, but <em>fail to even make it into production</em>.</strong> (Let's put a pin in that exact statement for a moment - I'll come back to that specific claim shortly, but I have no issues with that general prediction.) The article pinpoints knowledge management as a central, non-negotiable prerequisite that many organizations kinda gloss over before throwing AI at a problem. The result is, at best, delayed timelines for implementation while data is audited, organized, formatted for AI, contextualized, and properly curated and maintained; at worst (I reckon far more commonly), completely untrustworthy and irreplicable results from a black box model trained on data that no one fully understands or can articulate. </p>
<p>And even worse than <em>that</em>, <strong>it's not a given that the untrustworthy model would even be recognized as such</strong>. (I'll have <em>much</em> more to say on this at some point hopefully soon - I recently spent six months on a project evaluating Natural Language Processing models for named entity recognition and summarization tasks, and boy howdy did I learn a lot about how tricky it is to correctly implement and evaluate even seemingly simple tasks, and how fallible evaluation metrics can be. In short, it's very VERY easy and undoubtedly tempting to say "high accuracy number good", but the reality is that all you know is that "high accuracy number high", not that "high" = "good" for the task, nor that "accuracy number" is the right number to be looking at in the first place.) </p>
<p>One wonders how many of the projects currently having AI thrown at them would be sufficiently, if not better, addressed by just implementing the robust KM practices you'd need to have in place anyway to make the AI implementation a success. But KM doesn't have the same cachet as AI does at the moment, and orgs are feeling huge pressure to get in on the AI gold rush before their competitors do, even if the gains are illusory.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my next article:</p>
<h3 id="every-reason-why-i-hate-ai-and-you-should-too-marcus-hutchins-malwaretech"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/08/08/things-i-read-this-week-1-km-failures-ai-roboros-and-the-worst-neologism-ever/#every-reason-why-i-hate-ai-and-you-should-too-marcus-hutchins-malwaretech"><a href="https://malwaretech.com/2025/08/every-reason-why-i-hate-ai.html">Every Reason Why I Hate AI and You Should, Too</a> (Marcus Hutchins, MalwareTech)</a></h3>
<p>This article by cybersecurity legend Marcus Hutchins is very, very worth reading in full yourself, and I basically agree with everything he wrote here. I personally align with his third category of opinions from "reasonable" people he's talked to re: AI, with the perspective of "<strong>the tech has a narrow use case for which [it is] exceedingly valuable, but almost everything else is just hype</strong>". Hutchins was talking here about generative AI specifically, but I'd include other applications as well; referring back to a previous point, it's likely that some if not many use cases currently being addressed by "sprinkling some AI on it"<sup id="fnref2:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../../2025/08/08/things-i-read-this-week-1-km-failures-ai-roboros-and-the-worst-neologism-ever/#fn:2">2</a></sup> could be addressed just as well if not better by more conventional means - better KM, judiciously applied statistics, etc. </p>
<p>Hutchins goes on to say a lot of really insightful stuff about the "big tech AI hedge bet" on the race to AGI, "trickle-down hypenomics", and more about how LLMs specifically will <em>not</em> be the answer to AGI despite receiving a huge amount of the attention (seriously, just <a href="https://malwaretech.com/2025/08/every-reason-why-i-hate-ai.html">go read the article</a> - he lays all of this out much better than I can paraphrase). It's all fascinating, food for thought, and I'll be diving more into these topics soon I'm sure. But I found myself really resonating <em>personally</em> with the section titled "<strong>The Snake is Already Eating Its Own Tail</strong>". </p>
<h4 id="the-ai-roboros-get-it"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/08/08/things-i-read-this-week-1-km-failures-ai-roboros-and-the-worst-neologism-ever/#the-ai-roboros-get-it">The AI-roboros (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros">get it?</a>)<sup id="fnref2:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../../2025/08/08/things-i-read-this-week-1-km-failures-ai-roboros-and-the-worst-neologism-ever/#fn:3">3</a></sup></a></h4>
<p>Hutchins describes the issue of "source cannibalization" and why it's likely to be a death knell sooner rather than later for LLM development:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right now big tech companies operate in a temporary utopia where they’ve been able to capitalize on mass-scale copyright infringement as a result of the free and open internet, but have not yet started to suffer the consequences of the damage they’re causing to the information ecosystem.</p>
<p>LLMs act as a sort of magic funnel where users only see the output, not the incalculable amounts of high-quality human-produced data which had to be input. As such, it’s likely people significantly overestimate how much their work (prompting) contributed to the output they received, and grossly underestimate how much of other peoples’ work was required to make it possible. It’s classic egocentric bias.</p>
<p>This kind of bias leads to people ignoring the threat LLMs pose to their own data sources. The problem is further amplified by AI slop (low-quality AI generated content), which floods the internet, degrading the average quality of information. This slop not only makes it harder for humans to find high-quality sources, but harder to train LLMs, since allowing the slop to enter LLMs datasets risks creating a feedback loop which could cause the LLM to undergo model collapse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know about you, reader, but I've already noticed the proliferation of obviously AI-generated content across the web. Hell, I've played with generating some myself (<em>not</em> this site/blog - this is all me, baby!). It's admittedly fun and a cool parlor trick, and it can even be useful to word-vomit into a ChatGPT window and have it re-organize your thoughts into something more coherent. </p>
<p>However, for all the glitter and fun, there are some seriously dark implications for the Internet, for data, for individuals, and for society. (I'm not even going to touch the environmental impact here, as that's well beyond my area of expertise, but there's obviously plenty to keep you up at night about there too.) Hutchins speaks above to some of these: the mass-scale copyright infringement and theft required to train these LLMs in the first place; the ongoing threat to the quality of data and chilling effect on new, original, content; the inevitable ebb of LLM training, or at least of training quality, as a result of the degradation across the Internet. </p>
<p>Hutchins doesn't speak to this directly, but I've been thinking a lot about AI-generated image quality in particular, and how that's evolved over the last couple years. Just a few years ago (maybe not even? what even is time anymore), it was easy to tell at a glance that an image had been AI-generated; there were certain tells (number of fingers or limbs, a weirdly grainy, over-saturated quality to a lot of images, etc.) and a certain uncanny-valley-ness that was easy to pinpoint if not describe. That "uncanny valley" only lasted a few years, though. Nowadays, it's getting harder and harder to tell what's been AI-generated or altered, or not. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/midjourney/comments/11upu8t/v1_v5_using_the_same_prompt/">This Reddit post from two years ago shows the evolution in Midjourney from v1 to v5</a> and already at that point one could be forgiven for failing to notice at a glance that the v5 image was AI-generated. And that was two years ago! Two years ago is a whole era ago in terms of AI evolution.</p>
<p>In terms of text, we're still in the "uncanny valley" era where you can "just tell" that something has been generated by ChatGPT: the dashes, the "it's not [x], it's [y]" phrasing, emoji-fronted checklists, obnoxious calls to action at the end of every paragraph. But we'll surely move past that soon if not already (I haven't tried out GPT5 yet; maybe today's the day!) and I think that will be the true existential threat to the Internet or certain chunks of the Internet (hello Reddit). The unwritten social contract and trust underlying message boards and social media since their inception will be irrevocably broken: if I have no reason to believe that there are any humans left on the Internet (or any way to tell who is human from what is an AI agent), why would I go there to socialize?</p>
<h4 id="faux-ductivity-llms-as-brain-candy"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/08/08/things-i-read-this-week-1-km-failures-ai-roboros-and-the-worst-neologism-ever/#faux-ductivity-llms-as-brain-candy">Faux-ductivity: LLMs as Brain Candy<sup id="fnref2:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../../2025/08/08/things-i-read-this-week-1-km-failures-ai-roboros-and-the-worst-neologism-ever/#fn:4">4</a></sup></a></h4>
<p>Hutchins also wrote at length in his article about the threats implicit in LLM use not only on an internet-wide level, but also to the individual using it.</p>
<p>Per Hutchins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By allowing people to quickly summarize &amp; manipulate the work of others, LLMs use gives the same feeling of achievement one would get from doing the work themselves, but without any of the heavy lifting...</p>
<p>LLMs are somewhat like lossy compression of the entire internet. They boil nuanced topics down into a form that isn’t quite layperson level, but loses a lot of nuance while still evoking a feeling of complete understanding. The part that’s missing is, you don’t know what you don’t know. If you lack an intricate understanding of the task you’re using an LLM for, you have no idea what nuance was lost, or worse, what facts it made up...</p>
<p>When people use LLMs, they aren’t just being presented with flimsy surface level understandings of topics. They’re often outsourcing many of their means of reinforcing knowledge to the AI too. And in some cases, their logic and reasoning itself. The more people lean on LLMs, the more likely they are limit their knowledge expansion, undergo skill regression, and weaken their logic and reasoning ability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically: LLM usage can not only make you feel like you've understood something when you haven't (even assuming that the summary it gives is factual, which we've already established is not actually a safe assumption!); LLMs can also make you feel like you've accomplished or produced something when you haven't. </p>
<p>I've experienced this personally. As I've <a href="../../2025/07/10/in-defense-of-handwriting/">written about before</a>, LLMs make it very easy, and actually <em>actively encourage you to</em>, produce tons of words about a topic, without actually leaving the chat window to go work on it, or solidify what you've 'discussed'. It's basically that feeling of looking up from a book and realizing you didn't take in the last 3 paragraphs you read, except magnified. </p>
<p>In terms of actually producing or doing things, it's so so enticing and convincing to <em>feel</em> like you've accomplished a lot, but when you walk away, it's all just ephemeral words in a box. A GPT will encourage and cheerlead you all the livelong day to build out a 90-day learning plan to study for whatever exam, build a tracker for your new fitness or nutrition plan, whatever, and it'll feel good! But then when you get up from your desk, you'll still have just spent hours sitting at your desk staring at a screen by yourself <a href="../../2025/07/16/strange-loops-elegant-recursion-or-km-trap/">and you won't actually have produced anything even though it feels like you did</a>. </p>
<p>Of course, the LLM doesn't care what you've produced; after all, <em>your engagement with the LLM</em> is the primary measure of success for proprietary LLMs, <em>not</em> whether you actually go do/learn the thing or not. But for you, the person who actually sat down presumably wanting to plan to <em>do</em> something, this is a problem.<sup id="fnref2:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../../2025/08/08/things-i-read-this-week-1-km-failures-ai-roboros-and-the-worst-neologism-ever/#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>
<h4 id="the-hypothetical-ai-accelerated-employee"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/08/08/things-i-read-this-week-1-km-failures-ai-roboros-and-the-worst-neologism-ever/#the-hypothetical-ai-accelerated-employee">"The Hypothetical AI-Accelerated Employee"</a></h4>
<p>Hutchins wraps up his article by addressing "the hypothetical AI-accelerated employee":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The popular wisdom that’s seen as somewhat of a middle ground between “LLMs are useless plagiarism machines” and “LLMs are going to replace everything ever” is the hypothetical AI-accelerated employee. While not necessarily terrible advice, I feel like the mainstream interpretation is the opposite of what the advice should be.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, “prompt engineering” or whatever they’re calling it these days, has a skill cap that’s in the floor. Prompting LLMs simply just isn’t a skill, no matter what influencers who definitely weren’t previously claiming Bored Apes are the new Mona Lisa say. If you look at the prompts even the LLM developers themselves are using its things like “please don’t make stuff up” or “think extra hard before you answer”.</p>
<p>In fact, I’d make a strong argument that what you shouldn’t be doing is ‘learning’ to do everything with AI. What you should be doing is learning regular skills. Being a domain expert prompting an LLM badly is going to give you infinitely better results than a layperson with a ‘World’s Best Prompt Engineer’ mug.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This aligns with what I've personally heard when I've asked industry experts the exact same thing: the differentiating factor for consultants and other knowledge workers will not be being a great prompt engineer or what have you (although understanding how prompts work and what their limitations are is a great skill to have, it shouldn't be everything). I believe that <strong>the differentiating factor will be domain expertise, held by humans.</strong> </p>
<p>To paraphrase an executive I talked to recently, it's true that <strong>clients don't need consultants anymore for 101-level answers to generic technology or business questions, but what they do and will continue to need is help interpreting those answers in the context of their specific circumstances</strong><sup id="fnref2:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="../../2025/08/08/things-i-read-this-week-1-km-failures-ai-roboros-and-the-worst-neologism-ever/#fn:6">6</a></sup>. I think that that domain expertise and interpretation/extrapolation capability is only going to become rarer and more precious considering the slop proliferation and decline in actual productivity mentioned earlier. Hutchins predicts actual, <em>literal</em> mass cognitive decline as a result of widespread LLM use; I guess only time will tell. </p>

<p>The final piece that caught my attention this week in "AI, maybe not all it's cracked up to be?" news wasn't actually an article, but rather a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bkrebs_slopsquatting-wikipedia-activity-7358897169979842560-JNTS">LinkedIn post by cybersecurity investigative reporter Brian Krebs</a> that introduced me (unwillingly, nauseatedly) to the term <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slopsquatting">slopsquatting</a>. </p>
<p>It's actually a fascinating phenomenon, if thoroughly unsettling in name, implication, and scope, and I don't envy security professionals who will have to figure out how to deal with this. </p>
<p>I'm very much not an expert, but I'll try to explain as best as I can. </p>
<p>I haven't said much about the explosion of vibe-coding that's underway as we speak, but it's massive; essentially, using LLMs and other AI models to code applications, with all of the issues that we already discussed with LLMs. It's basically now really easy to generate an app that kinda maybe looks like it works on the surface, but without any understanding of what's going on under the hood. (I've dabbled with it, but quickly ran into the problem of the generated code outpacing what I understood about how it worked, and I abandoned my attempts after a few days of feeding error codes back into Cursor and getting increasingly unintelligible results.)  </p>
<p>Anyway. An inherent problem with LLMs, and one that is a basic component of their design (so impossible to fully mitigate), is that of <em>hallucination</em>: LLMs are essentially designed to mimic language (or in this case, machine language/code) convincingly based on the language or code they've been trained on. They have no ability to "understand" or reason about what they produce. They are therefore prone to "hallucinating" or making reference to events that never happened, court cases that never existed, etc. In the case of code, this includes software packages that don't exist, but that sound like others which do actually exist. </p>
<p>For example, per the Wikipedia article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2023, security researcher Bar Lanyado noted that LLMs hallucinated a package named "huggingface-cli".While this name is identical to the command used for the command-line version of HuggingFace Hub, it is not the name of the package. The software is correctly installed with the code pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]". Lanyado tested the potential for slopsquatting by uploading an empty package under this hallucinated name. In three months, it had received over 30,000 downloads.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the package is called two separate things in two separate contexts: the package is correctly called <strong>huggingface_hub[cli]</strong> when you want to install it with pip, but when have actually installed the package and want to use it, you call it by <strong>huggingface-cli</strong>. The LLMs saw the <strong>huggingface-cli</strong> invocation command and incorrectly assumed that the installation command would use the same name for the package. </p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, if you try to use <strong>pip install</strong> with an incorrect package name, you typically just get an error; up until now, it would be pretty clear when you're intending to install something specific and just typo the name or whatever, since presumably you'd be looking at documentation of some kind or other for the package. In other words, it's much more likely that you'd fail outright, and much less likely that you'd accidentally install something other than what you intended to install. Additionally, you'd presumably be looking at the command line yourself and have some expectation for what the output should look like even if you somehow managed to install the wrong thing, and have the knowhow to uninstall it. </p>
<p>But now, with LLMs abstracting away both the documentation (from the source side) and the explicit understanding/instruction (from the user side), there's room for a researcher to, say, create a dummy package that will get installed instead of the correct one next time the LLM hallucinates the same wrong command based on the same faulty assumption from the training data (which unfortunately <a href="https://www.lasso.security/blog/ai-package-hallucinations">happens a lot!</a>). It also means that vibe-coding users are less likely to even realize that the package they actually wanted wasn't actually installed, and/or that their application isn't behaving as expected, especially if the malicious package creator did any amount of work to hide their tracks (which would presumably be trivial for a dedicated cybercriminal who also have access to generative AI coding tools!). </p>
<p>Again, I have no clue how one would go about defending against or even detecting this problem. Just add it to the 4:00AM brain tape reel, I guess. </p>
<p>This is a kind of extension of a conversation I had recently with a friend who's a cyber threat researcher. This friend mentioned that their workplace is heavily encouraging use of AI to generate reports and, well, research threats, but the problem (besides the obvious of essentially requiring experts to train their AI replacements) is that AI is entirely credulous: it has no way to discern when someone is (<em>gasp</em>) lying on the Internet. The AI equivalent of "yup, this package looks totally legit, it has a GitHub README and everything", or "this construction site project can't be a scam, it has a website with stock photos of people in hard hats holding clipboards" - again, pointing back to the human domain expertise factor of it all.  </p>
<p>I don't really have a wrap-up for all this, sorry. It's Friday as I finish this draft I've been working on for days, the sunshine is calling me outside, and it seems fitting that I'd leave off <em>without</em> a ChatGPT-esque call to action. Okay, just one little one: <a href="https://youtu.be/DM4JJ6La1mI?si=uQkn7tvltyTe0yya&amp;t=300">Think about it, won't you? Thank you!</a>.</p>

<p>I was once invited last-minute to a meeting that was supposed to be a kind of kick-off or brainstorm session for a mysterious new initiative. Judging from the pre-meeting chatter as folks filed into the room, I wasn't the only person lacking context. </p>
<p>The meeting organizer came in and began outlining the project goals. Someone raised their hand and asked, reasonably, "<em>What's the priority level of this project, given other initiatives underway?"</em>. </p>
<p>I departed that organization shortly after this meeting (for unrelated reasons!), but I feel confident predicting the ultimate fate of that project: <strong>nothing ever came of it</strong> and it fizzled in development, if it made it that far (or, as Calvin put it, "<a href="https://featureassets.gocomics.com/assets/1dc6d380deb801317193005056a9545d?optimizer=image&amp;width=2800&amp;quality=85">(that) train of thought is still boarding at the station</a>").</p>
<p>Whence my confidence? Because in response to "what's the priority level of this project", the answer was, verbatim, <strong>"it's somewhere in the top ten of our number two priority list"</strong>. </p>
<p>In other words, doomed.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is not to disparage the original project idea (I thought it was a good idea, and agreed it was sorely needed), nor doubt the sincerity of the organizer, or the good intentions of the other people in the room (it was a mercurial time for the team and I'm sure the priority lists <em>were</em> indeed in flux); rather, it's to highlight that <em>in spite</em> of those good intentions, the high quality of the idea, the good-will and desire from the team to get it done...it was likely doomed to fail before it started, because it simply wasn't a set priority. Or rather, everyone agreed that it <em>should</em> be done, but either couldn't or wouldn't allocate the resources and time to get it done, at least not at the expense of other ongoing concerns.</p>
<h3 id="this-is-how-knowledge-management-dies"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/07/23/how-to-doom-a-project-with-one-sentence/#this-is-how-knowledge-management-dies">This is how knowledge management dies</a></h3>
<p>Lots of KM efforts fall into this trap. I think that this inability to "put it somewhere in the top ten of the <strong>number <em>one</em> priority list</strong>" can arise for several reasons: one of the biggest culprits I've personally observed is when a team expands really quickly, KM doesn't scale accordingly, and a total monster is created. </p>
<p>It might look like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Small, tight-knit, fast-moving team works in close coordination on a project that is ambitious, but early enough in its conception that it's feasible for just a few SMEs to be working on it. Because the project is small and the team is tightly coupled, there's a lot of tacit, institutional knowledge shared informally among the group (hello, Slack threads). It's common for someone to be the "go-to" person for particular tasks or questions, and the small group of SMEs tend to handle issues or inquiries personally on the fly. </li>
<li>The team and the project both expand, <em>fast</em>, and the original SMEs are either promoted into lead positions or otherwise abstracted away from the hands-on work they were originally doing. Lots of new hires hit the team and begin to get tasks delegated to them that the original SMEs were doing (or, worse, the original SMEs keep firefighting because they're too busy to properly hand off tasks). The people with the most context are now too busy to document what they know.</li>
<li>The first wave of new hires either shadow SMEs to learn how to perform tasks, and may document their findings, or just do their best to improvise new processes for new tasks as they come up. The first wave of new hires become the new SMEs for the product, another wave of new hires join the team, and the process repeats. Everyone is so busy trying to either onboard, learn the product, train others, or stand up new product lines or teams, that it leaves little time for knowledge capture. There is little to no set standard/template or standard process for writing, publishing, or updating documentation, which leads to a chilling effect for even people who have the time and inclination to document things.</li>
<li>A year later, the knowledge base/SharePoint site/Confluence site/what have you is an unholy stew of outdated articles, orphaned attachments, broken links, and siloed actually-still-useful artifacts that only a few people know how to find. No one bothers with the sidebar or homepage, but rather Slacks each other the one or two links that have relevant information on them, often with disclaimers like "Step 5 says to (x), but ignore that. You actually have to..."</li>
<li>The knowledge/documentation debt becomes unsustainable, and it's determined that <em>something</em> needs to be done to, uh, document stuff - but the original issues of "everyone is so busy" not only haven't gone away, they may have gotten worse. In addition, lots of the articles/documentation that's marginally useful was written by people who have since left the team, processes have fractured, Humpty Dumpty is in the arms of an angel, and who can afford all the kings horse's and all the king's men?</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, even strong teams can struggle to dig themselves out.</p>
<p>If this sounds familiar, don't despair - you're definitely not alone. I'd even go so far as to say that this is a normal experience for expanding teams, and requires rather remarkable foresight and effort from the outset to forestall. To be honest, I've rarely seen it done well. But my recommendation would be, for those wanting to try: <strong>dedicate, empower, and integrate a KM specialist from the very beginning, or as close as possible, to drive knowledge capture and knowledge management culture</strong>. </p>
<p>Like security or FinOps, knowledge management is above all a distributed issue, but it only works with a clear owner; everyone has a role to play, but it's imperative to have a centralized person or team in place to help set and socialize quality standards, assist team members with questions, and generally be "the voice" of knowledge management on a team. </p>
<p>In short: if no one does it, no one will do it - and if no priority is set, the priority level is automatically "zero". </p>

    <h2 id="strange-loops-elegant-recursion-or-km-trap"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/07/16/strange-loops-elegant-recursion-or-km-trap/">Strange Loops: Elegant recursion, or KM trap?</a></h2>
<p>Douglas Hofstadter coined the phrase "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop">strange loop</a>" to refer to a system in which you move through different layers of abstraction before returning to where you started - but somehow different, or with a twist. For example, Escher's <em><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/66/Ascending_and_Descending.jpg">Ascending and Descending</a></em> features staircases that loop and fold back impossibly on each other in recursive space. </p>
<p>Or, for example, this site - where I'm documenting my process of building the site itself. In other words, blogging about building the blog on which I'm blogging, thus building the blog on which I'm blogging about building... I think you get it. And honestly, it can be a bit of a struggle.</p>
<p>The struggle isn't in the writing itself, but more in breaking out of the KM loop which can quickly become an elegant, seductive, recursive dead end. I think it's a common pitfall for knowledge work - that is, getting so far in the weeds on organizing, mapping, planning, even aesthetics, that one never actually gets around to, y'know, the thing you were actually supposed to be doing. </p>
<p>This goes triple for personal projects, which suffer from both not having an externally-imposed deadline, and also having personal stakes - the carrot of feeling productive (while not actually producing) matched with the stick of "what if it's not good enough" is a combination which can be fatal to actual output.</p>

<p>(My specialty, unfortunately.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Jot some notes down to draft or conceptualize something.</li>
<li>Realize that you need a system to organize the notes you wrote to capture the thing you thought. </li>
<li>Realize that the system is imperfect.</li>
<li>Refactor the system to organize the notes better, and document what you refactored.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2-4 for the <em>documentation of the notes on the refactor of the system you designed to organize the notes about the conceptualization of the original thing you were going to do, ahhhhhh</em></li>
<li>Never get around to actually doing the thing you were jotting notes about in step 1. </li>

<p>Another greatest hit: get stuck researching <em>just the right tool</em> (or plugin, or extension, or what have you) for days on end until you forget what you were going to use it for and give up on everything entirely. </p>
<p><strong>See also:</strong> "<em>this</em> day planner is the one, I really mean it this time". (I know it's a trap. I'm still gonna buy it. I'm a sucker for a fresh notebook.) </p>

<p>Spend so much time optimizing the workflow and refining the content that you make yourself heartily sick of it and never even look at it again, thus defeating the original purpose of either imparting or gleaning insight. A related terror is, getting so wrapped up in endless edits and polishes that you never even publish anything. The refinement loop becomes more comfortable (because it's still "productive"-feeling!) than actually putting things into production.</p>

<p>Spend way too much time trying to over-engineer your system to handle edge cases and solve problems you haven't even encountered yet.</p>
<p>I actually ran into this earlier today when I was trying to impose tag categories on my <a href="../../../topics/">topics</a> page. I spent <em>far</em> too long researching plugin configurations and troubleshooting and looking up how to implement nested tags, instead of thinking harder about whether I even needed tag categories in the first place. Spoiler: I don't! At least, not right now. I have, like, seven pages on this whole site. </p>

<p>I'm still working on recognizing and breaking these loops, because you can't just <em>never</em> organize or edit anything. But I do have a few strategies I'm trying out for my personal projects, at least:</p>
<h4 id="develop-a-preference-for-production-over-planning"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/07/16/strange-loops-elegant-recursion-or-km-trap/#develop-a-preference-for-production-over-planning">Develop a preference for production over planning.</a></h4>
<p><em>Actual</em> production, i.e., pushing actual content updates to my actual GitHub Page. Reorganization is officially lower on the priority list (not off!!! just lower).</p>

<h4 id="embrace-messy-velocity"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/07/16/strange-loops-elegant-recursion-or-km-trap/#embrace-messy-velocity">Embrace messy velocity.</a></h4>
<p>Let things be "good enough", including findability. If it's important enough, and hard enough to find, I can always come back later. </p>
<p>In other words, <strong>iterate only when friction demands</strong>. </p>
<p>(This also demands that one understands what "friction" actually is, which encourages good understanding of user experience, = win win.)</p>
<p>In summary, as my father always says, </p>

<p>After all, the point isn't to have a set of perfected blog posts I never share with anyone, is it? </p>

<p><em>insert excited squeals</em></p>
<p><strong>BLUF:</strong> I got my very own CD pipeline going with GitLab! Hot dog! Not bad for a sweatpants Saturday. </p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> CI/CD stands for "Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery", and it's a widely-used practice in software development which enables teams to automate different stages of the release lifecycle (for example, building, testing, validation, and deployment to different environments). Automation is fantastic because it ensures that a baseline of steps are applied the same way each time, thus eliminating both the time it would take to do everything manually, as well as the potential for slip-ups or deviation from standard. In other words, it helps teams deploy their code quickly, cleanly, and reliably.</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong>
For my site specifically, my "before" update workflow looked like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make updates (e.g., write a blog post) in Cursor.</li>
<li>Save the changes.</li>
<li>Commit and push the changes to GitLab, where my source code is tracked.</li>
<li>Build the MkDocs site manually.</li>
<li>Copy the /site folder to another directory which pushes to my GitHub Pages repo.</li>
<li>Commit and push the /site file changes to GitHub, which actually displays the changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Friends, no one has time for all this, and the chances were <em>extremely</em> high that I would simply forget to actually push the changes to GitHub at all. (One of the things I really like about <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org">MkDocs</a> is that you can preview your changes as you're making them, but this also lends me to believe that those changes are actually live when they're not!) Now, my workflow looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make updates (e.g., write a blog post) in Cursor.</li>
<li>Save the changes.</li>
<li>Commit and push the changes to GitLab, where my source code is tracked. </li>
</ol>
<p>That's it! GitLab automatically pushes the changes to GitHub Pages for me. </p>
<p>Now, a caveat at this point is that whenever I commit changes to source (i.e., GitLab), they will go live immediately on GitHub. I don't <em>necessarily</em> want that in the long term (I'll likely look at implementing releases soon, to be able to better batch updates), but for right now, it's nice to have the deployment streamlined a bit. It's just nice to be back in the CLI saddle again.</p>

    <h2 id="in-defense-of-handwriting"><a class="toclink" href="../../2025/07/10/in-defense-of-handwriting/">In Defense of Handwriting</a></h2>
<p>As a technical writer (and general tech dabbler and person-of-the-new-millenium), I do a lot of typing. There's a lot, a <em>lot</em>, to recommend typing and even voice capture, and they indisputably have their benefits - speed, neatness, ease of editing, compatibility with other invaluable applications... it's hard to even imagine a time before Track Changes and SharePoint and the like made it seamless to share what you're working on with others. (The auto-save feature alone... as a millenial, I unfortunately have access to the collective consciousness of the horror where the power goes out and you realize you haven't hit Save on your biology term paper since 3:00 and it's almost midnight and due tomorrow...!). </p>
<p>I've also recently typed a lot into LLM windows for ideating, brainstorming, and so on. I've experimented with AI for, among other things, project and trip planning, recipe tweaking, and even some creative writing (with admittedly mixed results). It has its uses, for sure, and I've been enjoying playing with it to discover my own groove. I certainly don't think it's going anywhere, at any rate.</p>
<p>All of <em>that</em> said, I've also been doing more handwriting lately, and actually turning away from typing and GPT for certain things. I'm still feeling it out, but my "handwriting preferred" modes tend to fall into two general flavors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>When I need to memorize or "bake in" content</strong>. I've prepared for a lot of tests and exams in my time, and have tried a lot of different tools for studying and reviewing material. In short, although LLMs are incredible tutors, they can't actually learn the material for me. It's unfortunately very easy to move a lot of words around on a screen without actually internalizing the content. To actually memorize or get concepts baked into my brain, to this day, nothing has worked better for me than writing study notes out by hand, and writing flash cards by hand to review. I'm also a big believer in the aesthetics of study, and there's something about having just the right pen (extra-fine point rollerball, please), a cute notebook, and bright, cheerful highlighters to help solidify a concept. Once I've got a grasp on the material, <em>then</em> it's time to open up ChatGPT and ask it to quiz me. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Related, <strong>when I need to process something</strong>. Journaling, venting, even to-do lists - I've experimented with typing these, and have justified it on the grounds of "if I just write it in a random notebook, how will I be able to find it later?" But this assumes that I even <em>want</em> to find anything later, which in my case I've come to realize is a flawed assumption. I've got piles of old journals in a box in my office which I haven't opened once, and honestly recoil at the thought of re-reading. More to the point, journaling, to me, isn't an exercise I do for posterity; it's a cobweb-clearing activity, a way to get messy, raw things out of my brain so I can go about the rest of my day (shout out to <a href="https://www.bbcmaestro.com/blog/morning-pages-journal-how-to-start">Julia Cameron</a>!). In that respect, posterity is pressure, and the ease of editing typed documents actually works against me. I find myself self-editing, questioning, doubting, and <em>not writing</em>. </p>
<ul>
<li>This also goes for early stages of <strong>creative writing</strong> as well - LLMs, for example, are fun for ideation and riffing, but (for me, anyway) fall short of getting actual (me-sounding) words on the page. I've experimented with describing a scene in detail and having ChatGPT produce a first draft, for example, thinking that it would help me get over "the terror of the blank page", but so far it's caused more headaches than it's mitigated - I end up frustrated that it sounds <em>so</em> wrong and get bogged down in trying to fix something that I didn't even write in the first place. So: messy first drafts when I'm just trying to get something, anything, on paper are still hand-written, and transcribed into type later when it's time to make more sense/edit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The common factors between these modes seem to be that the writing is in some way <strong>ethereal or disposable</strong> (it's only for me; I don't intend to return to it once complete; I don't need to search it later). Content that I plan to share with others, that I plan to return to or refer to later, or that I want to save for posterity for some other reason, gets typed. </p>
<p>As more and more people experiment with AI tools for content creation, and learn their own personal approaches and best practices for learning and knowledge management, I suspect there will be a revival or rediscovery of the benefits of writing by hand. One can hope, anyway - it's one of those small pleasures, after all, and we could all surely use more of those. I haven't found a good substitute for the scritch of pen, the smell of good paper, etc., nor for the singular satisfaction of looking up and seeing an entire page filled top to bottom with your own handwriting. (Even if no one else can read it, as my friends remind me about my penmanship. Maybe <em>especially</em> if.) </p>
